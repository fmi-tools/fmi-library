# The problem with running the tests with regex flags is that they have dependencies, and this way we break it, and must partially
# specify the run order again... A better solution would be to attach the "--test-action memcheck" as a property to only some of the
# tests, but I can't find a way to do it.
#
# - 'ctest_build_all' is expected to give some memcheck warnings, but all other tests depend on it
# - we then run all the tests that are expected to pass memcheck
# - finally we run the tests that have are expected to fail memcheck, but have a dependency on one of the tests in the memcheck suite
#   to first run
