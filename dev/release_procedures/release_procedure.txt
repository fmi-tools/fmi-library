# FMI Library: release procedure

This document describes how to release FMI Library

# Terminology & Definitions
    versioning: major.minor.patch
    us_priv:    private upstream (modelon/fmi-library)
    us_public:  public upstream (modelon-community/fmi-library)

# Steps to follow 

- In the following steps, we assume that previous release was 2.0.2

1. If 'major' or 'minor' change, then create a new release branch first,
  e.g. 3.0.x or 2.1.x
2. If patch version update, just increment patch number (e.g. 2.0.2 -> 2.0.3,
   this is described in a later step)

Create release on us_priv:
    1. create prepare_2.0.3 branch
    2. update version and date in FMILIB_Readme.txt
    3. update RELEASE_NOTES.md
    4. pull request/merge to us_priv/master
    5. merge us_priv/master to us_priv/2.0.x
    6. push to us_priv/2.0.x
    7. verify 2.0.x is green on Jenkins
    8. tag release
       - do it on GitHub
       - just paste the relase notes for section "Describe this release"
       - attach documentation built from Jenkins (if not yet fixed in makefile, download the "html" dir as zip, then rename it: fmi_library_documentation_2.0.3.zip)

Then synch on us_pub:
    1. push to us_priv/master -> us_pub/master (git checkout master && git pull us_priv master && git push us_public master:master)
    2. push to us_priv/2.0.x -> us_pub/2.0.x (git checkout 2.0.x && git pull us_priv 2.0.x && git push us_public 2.0.x:2.0.x)
    3. since we want to attach binaries (the documentation in zipped format), repeat the same steps on GitHub for creating the tag as for us_priv, but now for us_pub
    4. resolve issues on public FMI Library as necessary

Publish on Yammer:

1. modify the template below, and add more text if you feel like it:

-------

FMI Library <VERSION> is now released!

You can find the source and the release notes on our public FMI Library GitHub page: <LINK_TO_TAG (public repo should be OK)>

NOTE: There are no binaries, this release includes only the source + generated documentation.

-------

2. paste the modified template at Yammer's FMI channel, and CC relevant people, such as AID+WEP+OCT team leaders
3. verify that links work in the Yammer post
